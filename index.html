          <h4>My name is Andrea Martz</h4>

          <p>Andrea Martz is a rising self-taught web developer and jack-of-all-trades in professional certification
            testing. She has
            worked 100% remotely for most of her career, while working 100% onsite as a mom to two incredible boys. As
            the only
            employee at a small company, Andrea improved products and processes to reduce costs and enhance client
            engagement and
            satisfaction. By necessity, she also was the Quality Assurance person checking her own work…and no errors
            ever went to a
            client. Andrea is happiest when there is variety in her work, interesting problems to solve, and the chance
            to
            collaborate, because that almost always means she’ll get to learn new skills and help others learn also.</p>

          <p>In her personal life, she is a known finder of resources for parents who are looking for ways to advocate
            for their
            highly gifted kids in K-12 schools. She also enjoys exploring national parks and taking walks in the
            neighborhood with
            her husband.</p>

          <p>Currently, Andrea is on a quest without end to build her web development skills. Her goal is to become a
            full-stack web
            developer working to do good in the world with a team of friendly problem-solvers like herself. If your team
            is in need
            of a junior web developer, or if you just want to make a new connection, please reach out on Twitter
            @amartzcoder or
            LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamartz/</p>
